# Todo App

Hey Connections, I've been diving into JavaScript and React.js for the past month, and as part of my learning journey, I've developed the Todo app using React and Vite. Through this project, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of fundamental React concepts while also getting hands-on experience with local storage for data persistence. By creating this app, I solidified my knowledge of React components, state management, handling events, and conditional rendering.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: I can add new todo items to the list.
- **Delete Todo**: I can delete todo items from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Todo items persist in local storage, ensuring data persistence even after page refresh.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and usable across various devices and screen sizes.

## Next Steps

While I've successfully built this todo app, my journey doesn't end here. In my ongoing learning path, I'll explore advanced topics such as React routing, Context API, and Redux Toolkit. These concepts will empower me to handle more complex state management scenarios and build larger-scale front-end applications. Will post my upcoming projects, where I'll apply these newfound skills to create even more impressive applications!
